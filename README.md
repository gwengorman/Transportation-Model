# The Transportation Model:Neutrosophic Numbers
This thesis explains the Transportational Model as one of the key optimization problems in LP (Linear Programming). This essay will explain the three algorithms to solve this LP and includes a proof of the theorem: Bland's Rule. Lastly, it explores the idea of neutrosophic numbers (numbers that represent uncertainty) within the Transportation model to account for uncertainty in business operations.
